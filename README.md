# ExpertConnect – Multilingual Consulting App

This repository contains the scaffolding for **ExpertConnect**, a scalable multilingual consulting application as described in the game design document (GDD). The project is organized as a monorepo with separate frontend (React Native mobile) and backend (Node.js/Express) directories.

## Structure

- `frontend/` – React Native mobile application
- `backend/` – Node.js + Express API server

The **frontend** folder includes a minimal React Native setup (`App.tsx`, `app.json`, `package.json`, `babel.config.js`, `tsconfig.json`, etc.) and a `src` directory where you can add assets, components, screens, navigation, localization files, services, store, utilities, theme definitions, and constants.

The **backend** folder includes starter files for an Express server (`app.js`, `server.js`) and a `src` directory where controllers, routes, models, middlewares, services, utils, config, and locales should be placed.

Use this skeleton as a starting point when implementing the features described in the GDD.
